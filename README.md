This is the code and comments I made while going through the [Building Blocks of Express JS](http://mbsy.co/bDPnC) tutorial. I intend for this code and comments to become a starter boilerplate for a future project.

I've used git tags to organize my progress for each step in this tutorial.

	// To see the list of tags
	git tag -n
	
	// To move back and forth between tags
	git checkout [tagname]
	
	// EX:
	git checkout 3.1
